# Excutive Summary
We have gathered and cleaned 60k+ data from 5 sources using GCP Bigquery and Google Colab. We visualized 10+ gender disparity on employment, wage, and benefit using Google data studio and Tableau. Furthermore, we have developed a Mediation Regression model using R to analyze education effect on wage for both genders, and conducted bootstrapping to assess the effect.
